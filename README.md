# physVR
A method I developed for digitally representing physical objects in virtual reality to avoid user collisions and increase tracking area. I uploaded only the scripts because the unity files are cumbersome to get working with gitignore. Please contact me if you would like help implementing these scripts, as they are sparsely commented due to deadlines. For full information about what these scripts can be implemented to do, read the [poster](https://utdallas.box.com/v/physVR)
